       <p2 align="center" >Pakistan Sweet Home started as a project of Bait-ul-Mal in 2009 when a single child from Swat, KPK, was handed over to Mr. Zamurrad Khan,<br>
      Since then, Pakistan Sweet Home family has grown to 5 Sweet Home centers across Pakistan.
        <br>Our teams also work in the areas worst affected by poverty and climate crises, offering food parcels, funding access to education, essential medical care, and emotional healing to more than 10,000 children.</br>
        <br> As one of the first SECP-registered orphanages in Pakistan, our work has made a huge difference in young lives that may have been lost.</br>
